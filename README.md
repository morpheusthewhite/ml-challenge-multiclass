# ml-challenge-multiclass

A python notebook for the Programming challenge of the Machine Learning
(DD2421) course at KTH.

The provided data (located (guess where) in the `data` folder) consist of the
training data (`TrainOnMe.csv`) along with data to be labeled
(`EvaluateOnMe.csv`). 

The problem is a multiclass classification (there are 3 different labels) and it requires `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
